    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an analysis of each variable (column) from the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **age (numeric)**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Represents the age of the customer in years.\n",
    "   - **Example Values**: 19, 18, 28, 33, 50, etc.\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: Age is a key factor that could impact insurance charges. Older customers may have higher charges due to increased health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **sex (categorical)**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Represents the gender of the customer.\n",
    "   - **Categories**: \n",
    "     - male\n",
    "     - female\n",
    "   - **Example Values**: \"female\", \"male\".\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: Gender may play a role in healthcare costs, though this could vary depending on the region or the specific insurance policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **bmi (numeric)**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the customer, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight.\n",
    "   - **Example Values**: 27.9, 33.77, 22.705, 36.85, etc.\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: BMI is an important factor in health insurance costs. Higher BMI values may be associated with higher charges due to increased health risks such as obesity, diabetes, or heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **children (numeric)**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.\n",
    "   - **Example Values**: 0, 1, 3, etc.\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: The number of children may affect insurance costs as plans with more dependents could have higher premiums or medical expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **smoker (categorical)**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Indicates whether the customer is a smoker.\n",
    "   - **Categories**: \n",
    "     - yes\n",
    "     - no\n",
    "   - **Example Values**: \"yes\", \"no\".\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: Smoking is strongly correlated with health risks, leading to significantly higher charges for smokers due to the potential for more severe health issues like lung disease, cancer, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **region (categorical)**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Geographic region where the customer resides.\n",
    "   - **Categories**: \n",
    "     - southwest\n",
    "     - southeast\n",
    "     - northwest\n",
    "     - northeast\n",
    "   - **Example Values**: \"southwest\", \"southeast\", \"northwest\", \"northeast\".\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: The region could influence healthcare costs due to differences in regional healthcare availability, cost of living, or state-level healthcare policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **charges (numeric)**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The medical charges billed to the customer or their insurance provider.\n",
    "   - **Example Values**: 16884.92, 1725.55, 4449.46, 29141.36, etc.\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: This is the target variable we want to predict. It represents the total medical expenses incurred by the customer. Factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region are likely to have a strong impact on this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Insights:\n",
    "- **Age, BMI, and Smoking Habits** are likely to be the most influential factors affecting the **charges** due to their direct impact on health risks.\n",
    "- **Gender, Number of Children, and Region** may also contribute to variations in healthcare costs but possibly to a lesser extent than the other factors.\n",

As the lead data scientist, you are tasked with creating a predictive system that estimates the annual medical expenses for new customers using factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region of residence. These estimates are crucial for determining the monthly insurance premiums offered to customers. The system must also comply with regulatory standards by being able to explain its predictions.\n",
